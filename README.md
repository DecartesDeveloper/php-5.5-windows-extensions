PHP 5.5 Windows Extensions x86
==============================

Set of precompiled DLL extensions in Visual Studio 11 for 32bit version of PHP 5.5.
I just tried to compile as many extensions i was able to in the newest version in that time.
When the extension was not compatible with 5.5, i tried to fix it.

I DID NOT TEST MOST OF THEM. I just checked if it appears in phpinfo and sometimes called few functions.

IT WAS MEANT FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES, NOT FOR PRODUCTION. SO USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
